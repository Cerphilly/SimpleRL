#PETS: Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling
#combines uncertainty-aware deep network dynamics models withs sampling-based uncertainty propagation
#matches asymptotic performance of model-free algorithms while requiring significantly fewer samples
'''
Shooting algorithms:
provide a way to approximately solve the receding horizon problem posed in model predictive control(MPC)
when dealing with non-linear dynamics and non-convex reward functions.

#tutorial: dyna-q in frozenlake-v0, have fun
#first do Random Shooting(RS)
then PETS(may do MBMF)
let's master mbrl
